				<h1 align="center">THE NEED FOR BLOOD</h1>
				
				<p>Your blood's main components are red cells, plasma and platelets.  These are used to treat many different illnesses and conditions.
				<br />They have a short shelf life, so we always need to top up the supply:
				
				<ul>
					<li>red blood cells can be stored for up to 35 days</li>
					<li>platelets can be stored for up to 7 days</li>
					<li>plasma can be stored for up to 3 years</li>
				</ul>
				
				
				</p>
				
				<h2 style="color:red">Maintaining Blood supply</h2>
				<p>We need to make sure that we have enough supplies of all blood groups and blood types to treat all types of conditions.
				We need to maintain a regular supply of all blood groups and types so we can provide it to the hospitals and patients who need it.<br /><br />

				Some rare sub-types are more common in specific communities, which is why we particularly need more black donors and are always looking for more blood donors from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. 
				<br /> <br />
				We sometimes need to target specific blood types to increase stock levels. That's why we sometimes contact regular donors with the particular blood type we need, and ask them to give blood.
				<br /> <br />
				We are indebted to our regular blood donors for their role in helping us to save lives.
				<br /> <br />

				<h1 align="center">THE DONATION PROCESS</h1>
				
				<p>Giving blood is simple and it saves lives. When you give blood, 
					it is collected so it can be used to treat someone else.<br />
					
					For most people, giving blood is easy and follows the simple steps
					listed below. See our animation which takes you through what happens
					step by step.
					
					<h2 style="color:red">Before you give blood</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Check if you are able to ive blood</li>
						<li>Find an appointment: A number of appointments can be booked in
							advance. If you are unable to book now, then please try for 
							a later date.A limited number of walk-in slots are available.</li>
						<li>Register to be a donor online, call <a style = "color: aqua" href = "tel:+917204069657">+91 7204069657</a>, or attend a
							donation venue.</li>
						<li>Follow the preparing to give blood recommendations.</li>
						<li>If you are unable to keep your donation appointment please try and
							give us at least 72 hours notice. You can cancel or reschedule by 
							signing in to your online account.</li>
						
					</ol>
				
				
				</p>
				
				<h2 style="color:red">When you give blood</h2>
				<p>This is what will happen when you attend your appointment, or go to a 
					drop-in session, to give blood. If you attend an appointment to give blood 
					we aim to ensure it takes no more than an hour.
					
					<h3 style="color:#DC143C">1. Welcome and preparation</h3>
					</p>
						We will ask you to read our welcome leaflet (pdf) which explains the 
						importance of blood safety. It is important to read this whenever you attend 
						because advice does change. We will give you 500ml of fluid just before you 
						give blood. Drinking this over about 5 minutes will help with your well-being 
						during and after donation.
					</p>
					
					
					<h3 style="color:#DC143C">2. Health screening</h3>
					</p>
						We make sure it is safe for you to donate, and that your blood donation is safe 
						for a patient to receive
						
						<ul>
							<li>We confirm your identity and ask you about the information on your donor health check form; a registered nurse may follow up if necessary.</li>
							<li>We test a drop of blood from your finger to check the iron levels (haemoglobin) in your blood.</li>
							
						</ul>
						
						If you are not able to donate we will explain why, and may ask you to make another appointment. <br /> <br />
						
						If you are able to donate you will be asked to sit in a waiting area until you are called to a donation chair. 
						
					</p>
					
					<h3 style="color:#DC143C">3. Your blood donation</h3>
					
					</p>
						When you are comfortable on the chair we will ask you to confirm your name, address and date of birth.<br /><br />
						
						We examine your arm and place a cuff on your arm to maintain a small amount of pressure during donation (this does not measure blood pressure).<br /><br />
						We then examine your arm to find a suitable vein and clean it with an antiseptic sponge.<br />
						
						<ol>
							<li>We will insert a needle in your arm which will collect your blood into a blood bag with your unique donor number.</li>
							<li>You should not feel any discomfort or pain. If you do, tell a member of staff.</li>
							<li>A scale weighs the blood and stops when you have donated 470ml (or just under a pint). This usually takes between 5-10 minutes.</li>
							<li>The needle will be removed and a sterile dressing applied to your arm.</li>
							
						</ol>
